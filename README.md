student grade

Write a new c++ program to 
•	Store name and 3 grades of a student in the main function, taking them from the user
•	Use a function (find_sum()) having passed the 3 grades to find the sum of those grades and return the added value to a variable sum in the main function.
•	Use a function (find_avg()) having passed the sum, to find the average of the grades.
•	Use a function (find_result()) having passed the average, to find the result as follows:
Average grade percentage >= 80, output “distinction”
Average grade percentage  >= 50 and less than 80, output “passed”
Average grade percentage < 50 and greater than or equal to 0, output “failed”
